Create documents containing live code, equations, visualizations,
and explanatory text.

![The JupyterLab Hass.io add-on](images/screenshot.png)

## About

JupyterLab is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share
documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.
Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation,
statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

This add-on runs JupyterLab, which is the next-generation user interface for
Project Jupyter. It is an extensible environment for interactive and
reproducible computing, based on the Jupyter Notebook and Architecture.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Hass.io add-on.

1. [Add our Hass.io add-ons repository][repository] to your Hass.io instance.
1. Install the "JupyterLab Lite" add-on.
1. Start the "JupyterLab Lite" add-on
1. Check the logs of the "JupyterLab Lite" add-on to see if everything went well.

**NOTE**: Do not add this repository to Hass.io, please use:
`https://github.com/hassio-addons/repository`.

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```json
{
    "log_level": "info",
    "github_access_token": "abcdef1234567890abcdef0123456789abcdef01",
    "ssl": true,
    "certfile": "fullchain.pem",
    "keyfile": "privkey.pem",
    "system_packages": [
      "ffmpeg"
    ],
    "init_commands": [
      "pip install virtualenv",
      "pip install yamllint"
    ]
}
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and past it! Create your own!_

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`:  Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `github_access_token`

Sets an GitHub access token. When making unauthenticated requests to GitHub
(as we must do to get repository data), GitHub imposes fairly strict rate-limits
on how many requests we can make. As such, you are likely to hit that limit
within a few minutes of work.

There is a chapter in this document with instruction on obtaining such a token.

**Note**: _This option support secrets, e.g., `!secret github_token`._

### Option: `ssl`

Enables/Disables SSL (HTTPS) on the JupyterLab Set it `true` to enable it,
`false` otherwise.

### Option: `certfile`

The certificate file to use for SSL.

**Note**: _The file MUST be stored in `/ssl/`, which is default for Hass.io_

### Option: `keyfile`

The private key file to use for SSL.

**Note**: _The file MUST be stored in `/ssl/`, which is default for Hass.io_

### Option: `system_packages`

Allows you to specify additional [Alpine packages][alpine-packages] to be
installed to your JupyterLab setup (e.g., `g++`. `make`, `ffmpeg`).

**Note**: _Adding many packages will result in a longer start-up time
for the add-on._

#### Option: `init_commands`

Customize your environment even more with the `init_commands` option.
Add one or more shell commands to the list, and they will be executed every
single time this add-on starts.

## Embedding into Home Assistant

It is possible to embed JupyterLab directly into Home Assistant, allowing
you to access the JupyterLab through the Home Assistant frontend.

Home Assistant provides the `panel_iframe` integration, for these purposes.

Example configuration:

```yaml
panel_iframe:
  jupyterlab:
    title: JupyterLab
    icon: mdi:flask
    url: https://addres.to.your.hass.io:7777
```

## Getting a GitHub access token

You can get an access token by following these steps:

1. [Verify][github-verify] your email address with GitHub.
1. Go to your account settings on GitHub and select "Developer Settings"
   from the left panel.
1. On the left, select "Personal access tokens"
1. Click the "Generate new token" button, and enter your password.
1. Give the token a description, and check the "**repo**" scope box.
1. Click "Generate token"
1. You should be given a string which will be your access token.

Remember that this token is effectively a password for your GitHub account.
*Do not* share it online or check the token into version control,
as people can use it to access all of your data on GitHub.

## Changelog & Releases

This repository keeps a change log using [GitHub's releases][releases]
functionality. The format of the log is based on
